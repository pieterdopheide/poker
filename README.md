Rust poker hand ranker

A program that generates two hands of 5 cards and compares them, determining which of the two is the better hand.
Written in Rust to learn and play with the language.
Inspired by a similar program written by Donne Martin (https://github.com/donnemartin/poker).

> TODO:
- low ace straight
- unit tests
- in the case that both hands have high card, use the highest card to determine the winner
